# Graduation thesis

This is my graduation thesis, a single page application that allows the user to:
- draw oriented graphs with mouse clicks;
- see the graphical rappresentation of powerset, downset of the drawed graph.

## How it's done

The thesis is divided in two big sections:
- graph contruction;
- graphs rappresentation.


For graph **contruction** I decided to use [P5.js](https://p5js.org/), a easy to use and very complete library for graphical web operations.

The graph **rappresentation** I went for [D3-Graphviz](https://github.com/magjac/d3-graphviz#api-reference) an amazing library that combine the Graphviz language (DOT language) and the render power of D3.js.
